Teensy-AudioPlayerTest (Mp3)
======================

Quick, dirty, and buggy :-)
Attention - tested only with tweaked Teensyduino (GCC 4.8.3).
Should compile with original too, but NOT TESTED.

Needs Teensy 3.1 + Audioboard, Teensyduino 1.20

Howto:
- Check serial connection in debug.h
- Check filenames in player.ino 
- Upload your mp3files to sd
- Overwrite the files in original "Audio"-Lib with the ones in "patch"
- Compile, upload sketch, enoy :-)
